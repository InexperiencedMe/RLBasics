# RLBasics
Old code with basic RL algorithms

This repo compiles some of my code implementations from March/April 2024, where I studied basic RL algorithms to start my journey with RL

It contains Q learning, DQN, PPO, SAC and early beginnings with my Unity RL library.

## Usage

Don't use this... Hehe. I tried running some code before uploading it to github and somehow I encountered errors. Some other files worked just fine, but I wouldn't take much inspiration from this repo.
I just wanted to document what I did in the past and I am happy with what I've done there, but I will not maintain or improve it.
I'd rather rewrite the whole thing when I need it. I already have my Universal SAC implemented in a private repo, that I hope to release one day.

I you wish to learn the algorithms, I recommend some of the sources I used below.

## Sources used

I believe my Q learning was inspired by [Huggingface Deep Reinforcement Learning course](https://huggingface.co/learn/deep-rl-course/unit0/introduction)

For DQN I used the [official PyTorch DQN example](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/reinforcement_q_learning.html)

For PPO and SAC I studied [CleanRL library](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl)

And Unity interface I was figuring out by myself with official documentation üòè But it's an old version, when I felt like I knew enough, I rewrote it.
